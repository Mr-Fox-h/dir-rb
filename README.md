# Dir-rb

My custom Ruby tool is a lightweight **web content scanner** designed to efficiently search for hidden files and directories on web servers. Inspired by the functionality of **Dirb**, this tool utilizes the power of Ruby to conduct targeted scans and identify existing web objects that may not be easily accessible through conventional browsing.

## Install

If you want to install **dir-rb** on your system, run this command:

```shell
$ gem install dir-rb
```
